          Hi Iâ€™m Dylan, I am a Digital Media BSc student at the University of
          the West of England. Growing up with technology all around me, I have
          always had an interest in how these machines and programs work. During
          my studies, I have taken a big interest in coding and would love to
          expand this knowledge further during my time here at the university.
